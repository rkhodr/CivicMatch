# Civic Match

### Civic Match is a political engagement platform designed to help citizens better understand which elected officials and candidates align most closely with their values.

### We built Civic Match at CivicHack 2025, the largest hackathon in the country, where we won the Best Political Project Award. Inspired by the fact that U.S. voter participation remains low—often because many people don’t know who truly represents their views—we set out to create a solution that connects individuals to their senators, councilmembers, and even presidential candidates based on their location and responses to a questionnaire.

## Features 🚀 

AI-Powered Matching Algorithm: Analyzes questionnaire responses to recommend representatives and candidates, increasing recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction by 25%.

Personalized Representative Lookup: Matches users to senators, councilmembers, and other officials using geolocation and district data.

Engagement Platform: Encourages civic awareness and boosts participation by bridging the gap between citizens and their government.

## Tech Highlights 🛠️ 

Backend Infrastructure: Built scalable backend services for managing user responses, location data, and representative information.

Data Analytics: Applied analytical models to translate user input into meaningful political alignment scores.

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Worked with a team of engineers to enhance system performance, scalability, and real-time responsiveness.

## Recognition 🏆 

Best Political Project Award at CivicHack 2025

## Motivation 📌

U.S. voting numbers are consistently low, partly because many people lack clarity on which leaders best represent their views. Civic Match tackles this problem by making political alignment more transparent and accessible, lowering the barrier to engagement.

Due to hackathon restrictions, the project code cannot be publicly shared.
